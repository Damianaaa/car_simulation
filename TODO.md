# Most urgent tasks
## 1. Create a sidebar for the window area management. Possible capabilities:
* Switch between simple textures. Later on if we click on the game area the chosen texture will appear with collision set.
* Possibility to add a simple texture with defined position and parameters.
* Live model position monitoring: Position, heading etc. 
## 2. Write tests and fix possible issues for collision manager
## 3. Add texture collision handling (e.g. car cannot drive into map borders or any objects)
## 3. Add distance calculations to lidar (simple and short one)
## 4. Add parameterized gaussian noise to lidar readings.
## 5*. Stabilize everything: write tests, visibility and check whole project structure.

### After all this will be done, it will be possible to write the first mapping algorithm :)
### In parallel kinematic model and its noise should be created.
